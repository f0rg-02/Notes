From Readme:


"Dirhunt is a web crawler optimize for **search and analyze directories**. This tool can find interesting things if the server has the _“index of”_ mode enabled. Dirhunt is also useful if the directory listing is not enabled. It detects directories with **false 404 errors**, directories where an **empty index file** has been created to hide things and much more."

Usage: `dirhunt http://website.com/`

Does not bruteforce nor is it a crawler.
